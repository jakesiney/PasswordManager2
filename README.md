# Password Manager 2

This Python application, originally created as a challenge during my time at Makers Academy, has undergone some refactoring since the first time I did it.

## Features

- **Add Password:** Users can securely add new passwords to the manager.

- **Update Password:** The application allows users to easily update their existing passwords.

- **Delete Password:** Users can delete passwords they no longer need, ensuring efficient management.

- **List Passwords for a Service:** Users can view a list of passwords associated with a specific service.

- **List Services for a Password:** This feature enables users to see a list of services linked to a particular password.

- **Sort and Reverse Order:** Lists can be sorted by the date added, providing users with flexibility. Additionally, there's an option to display lists in reverse order.

- **Password Constraints:** Passwords must adhere to specific criteria, ensuring they are secure. They must be greater than 8 characters and include at least one special character.

## Testing

The application has been test driven using Pytest.
